## Lore

### Pages
The building block of a tooru stash is a *page*, with defined name, lead, and body. The page can be either plaintext or Markdown. (HTML was a mistake.)

### Tags
A page can have *tags*. All tags are created equal, for now at least. Any relationship between tags (parent-child, restriction from user and to backend, etc.) would be defined in a separate schema.
